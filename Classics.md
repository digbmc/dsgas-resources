### Mapping:

The following websites provide maps and cartographic tools relating to the mapping of Classical sites, routes, connections, and people of the ancient world.

- [Hestia](https://hestia.open.ac.uk/hestia/): The Hestia project takes up the Greek historian Herodotus’ enquiry through the digital medias and technologies, and involves a collaborative team of researchers from Classical Studies, Geography and Digital Humanities. Using a digital text of Herodotus’ Histories, from which the project extracted all place-names, it uses web-mapping technologies such as GIS, Google Earth and Narrative TimeMap to investigate the cultural geography of the ancient world through the eyes of one of its first witnesses.

- [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/): Pleiades is a community-built gazetteer and graph of ancient places. It publishes authoritative information about ancient places and spaces, providing unique services for finding, displaying, and reusing that information under open license. 

- [ORBIS](http://orbis.stanford.edu/index.html): The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World reconstructs the time cost and financial expense associated with a wide range of different types of travel in antiquity. The model is based on a simplified version of the giant network of cities, roads, rivers and sea lanes that framed movement across the Roman Empire. It broadly reflects conditions around 200 CE but also covers a few sites and roads created in late antiquity. (Note, ORBIS is designed for modern browsers and uses technology that works best in Chrome or Safari.)
