# Digital Archaeology Resources:

This is a resource for archaeology students interested in digital archaeology and archaeology within digital humanities. This document includes links to journals, awards and fellowship opportunities, conferences, online archives and databases, as well as other programs, tools, and resources one may need to become further involved in these communities.

### Journals:

The following are peer-reviewed journals concerned with digital methods and research in the field of archaeology.

- [Internet Archaeology](https://intarch.ac.uk/")
- [The Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology](https://journal.caa-international.org/)
- [Archaeological Prospection](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990763)
- [Advances in Archaeological Practice](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice) 

### Awards/Fellowships:

The following is an award offered by the Archaeological Institute for America, which recognizes the value of digital scholarship, and aims to encourage its practice. The AIA offers this award to honor individuals, projects, and groups that deploy digital technology in innovative ways in the realms of excavation, research, teaching, publishing, or outreach.

- [Award for Outstanding Work in Digital Archaeology](https://www.archaeological.org/grant/digital-archaeology-award/) 

### Conferences:

- [Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA)](https://2020.caaconference.org/): The Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) is an international organization that works to bring together archaeologists, mathematicians and computer scientists. Its aims are to encourage communication between these disciplines, to provide a survey of present work in the field and to stimulate discussion and future progress. They hold a conference every year.

### Digital Archives/Databases for Archaeology: 

The following sites are digital databases and repositories for archaeological data. They support research, data management, digital data archiving, and collaboration. They offer a wide range of databases that vary in size and cost. Explore each site to learn which one would suit your needs. 

- [tDAR](https://www.tdar.org/about/) 
- [Open Context](https://opencontext.org/) 
- [Archaeological Data Service](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/)

## Tools/Programs/Resources:
The following resources provide tools, software, and digital programs that allow users to create maps, 3D models, storymaps, and more. 

#### Online Programs and Software:
- [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home): Esri is one of the leading manufacturers in geographic information system (GIS) technology, location intelligence, mapping software, and spatial analytics. It builds and offers programs such as ArcGIS, a software that combines mapping and data analytics to deliver location intelligence and meet digital transformation needs for organizations of all sizes.
  -Software programs offered by Esri include:
   * ArcGIS
   * ArcMap
   * 3D Analyst and ArcScene 
   * ArcGIS StoryMaps

- StoryMaps: Storymaps are one methods of digital story-telling through the use of maps, graphics, videos, and more. They are designed to be interactive, digital narratives based on maps and their data. 
  - [Knightlab](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/)
  - [Mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signin/?route-to=https://studio.mapbox.com/) 
  - [ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/)
   
- 3D Modeling Programs: The following sites are some of the more common resources used by researchers and students to create 3D models of their artifacts, buildings, sites, and more. 
   - [Artec and 3D Scanning](https://www.artec3d.com/)
   - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/)
   - [Computer-Aided Design and Drafting (CADD)](https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/cad-software)
   
- [Archaeofusion](http://archaeofusion.com/manual/application.htm?MenuState=AcOXw7VVV1V177SE77SGVe-0iu-0ihUtAQEAAA): ArchaeoFusion is a software package for assembling, processing, and integrating multiple geophysical datasets collected at an archeological site. It could be used for other applications in near surface geophysics, but was designed specifically for multi-sensor archaeological geophysics.
