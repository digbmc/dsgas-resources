# Digital Resources for Classics

This is a resource for students in Greek, Latin, and Classical Studies interested in both classics and digital tools within the wider realm of digital humanities. This site includes links to journals, awards and fellowship opportunities, conferences, online archives and databases, as well as other programs, tools, and resources one may need to become more involved in these communities. 

### Digital Texts

The following sites contain collections of Ancient Greek and Classical Latin works. Regarding themselves as digital libraries, these sites provide digital editions to works from the Classical Antiquity.

It covers all extant Latin texts from antiquity to approximately 600 CE. It includes the etymology of each Latin word and its development in the romance languages.

- [The Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts Series](https://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/lofts/): The Open Fragmentary Text series is a new effort by the University of Leipzig to establish open editions of ancient works that survive only through quotations or fragments or text re-uses in later written works. 

- [The Tesserae Project](https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/): The Tesserae project aims to provide students and scholars a flexible and robust web interface that allows them to explore intertextual parallels in Greek and Latin texts. 

- [Digital Latin Library](https://digitallatin.org/): The DLL Catalog provides an organized, curated online system for finding Latin texts that are available digitally. Currently, it contains nearly 3,000 authors and 5,000 works, with many more to come. It also contains individual item records for hundreds of texts available in a variety of formats through many different resources such as the Perseus Digital Library, the Packard Humanities Institute, DigilibLT, the HathiTrust Digital Library, and others.

- [DYABOLA](http://www.dyabola.de/en/indexfrm.htm?page=http://www.dyabola.de/): An online collection of books, book reviews, and journal articles in the disciplines of classics, prehistory and ancient history, archaeology, numismatics, epigraphy, and philology are indexed, including subject access based on the Realkatalog of the German Archaeological Institute. Contains several databases, the largest of which is the Archäologische Bibliographie, or "Realkatalog des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts Rom," the most comprehensive database for classical archaeology. Most of the citations are to works not in English.

- [Loeb classical library](https://www-loebclassics-com.proxy.brynmawr.edu/): The complete digital Loeb Classical Library is fully accessible via a Bryn Mawr College subscription. More than 520 volumes of Latin and Greek texts with English translation are available in a modern and elegant interface, allowing readers to browse, search, bookmark, annotate, and share content.

- [ToposText](https://topostext.org/): ToposText is an indexed collection of ancient texts and mapped places relevant the history and mythology of the ancient Greeks from the Neolithic period up through the 2nd century CE. 

### Mapping:

The following websites provide maps and cartographic tools relating to the mapping of Classical sites, routes, connections, and people of the ancient world.

- [Hestia](https://hestia.open.ac.uk/hestia/): The Hestia project takes up the Greek historian Herodotus’ enquiry through the digital medias and technologies, and involves a collaborative team of researchers from Classical Studies, Geography and Digital Humanities. Using a digital text of Herodotus’ Histories, from which the project extracted all place-names, it uses web-mapping technologies such as GIS, Google Earth and Narrative TimeMap to investigate the cultural geography of the ancient world through the eyes of one of its first witnesses.

- [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/): Pleiades is a community-built gazetteer and graph of ancient places. It publishes authoritative information about ancient places and spaces, providing unique services for finding, displaying, and reusing that information under open license. 

- [ORBIS](http://orbis.stanford.edu/index.html): The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World reconstructs the time cost and financial expense associated with a wide range of different types of travel in antiquity. The model is based on a simplified version of the giant network of cities, roads, rivers and sea lanes that framed movement across the Roman Empire. It broadly reflects conditions around 200 CE but also covers a few sites and roads created in late antiquity. (Note, ORBIS is designed for modern browsers and uses technology that works best in Chrome or Safari.)
